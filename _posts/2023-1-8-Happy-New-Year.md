My hope for anyone whom may be reading this, that 2023 treats you kindly and your code runs smoothly.

Like many others with new years resolutions, one of my goals for this year is to work on my own personal technical development by programming each day.

#### New Year, Better Programming
In addition to programming every day, the following are a few of my other goals for the year:
1. Create a personal blog site
2. Create an improved version of my resume site, including light & dark modes
3. Obtain Azure Data Fundamentals and Azure AI Fundamentals certifications

#### Jekyll and GitHub Pages
For goal #1, what better way to both learn a new skill and create a personal blog, than by learning how to use the jekyll library? 

To quick start the process of creating a static blog using jekyll and GitHub Pages, I forked this repository [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and followed Barry Clark's tutorial [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).

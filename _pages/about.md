Hi there! I am Michelle Heatherly.

I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer with 5+ years of professional experience developing software applications, scripting, maintaining, integrating new features into both modern and legacy systems, as well as cloud environments. I have a passion for creating things for others, whether that's with developing applications, creating websites, or through other means.

I hold BA from Wofford College, where I double-majored in Computer Science and German, in addition to a minor in Math. I also am CompTIA Security+ certified and hold multiple Azure certifications.

When I am away from my computer, I can be found cuddled up with my two tabby cats reading a good science fiction novel, hiking local trails with friends, or teaching vinyasa yoga.
